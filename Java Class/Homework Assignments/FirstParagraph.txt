You awaken from what feels like a long deep sleep and find yourself laying down in some sort of light blue bed.
However, the bed is not a normal bed.
It is emitting a soft glow and is enclosed by a sloping, circular wall.
It's almost like the bed is inside a giant egg.
A semi transparent screen flickers to life in front of your face and words begins scrolling across it.
