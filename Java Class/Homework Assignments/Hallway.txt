The voice suddenly cuts out and is replaced by static.
The door with the red lights above it slides slowly open.
You pick yourself up from the floor, step throught the door and into a hallway.
The hallway is lit by dim orange lighting.
Overly large letters on the wall read 'Level 20--Passenger Corridor'.
At the far end of the hallway is a door with the words 'Emergency Exit' glowing on it.
As you walk towards the emergency exit door you hear more explosions and the hallway shakes and shutters.
You begin running and reach the door.
