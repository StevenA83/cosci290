You hear a click and a hiss, the pod door slowly opens and you step out of it into a dimly lit room.
It looks like a small futuristic hotel room, with recessed lights on the ceiling, a small desk the Bio-Pod bolted to one wall.
All the room's surfaces gleam like they're made of soft shiny metal.
As you continue to look around the room, you hear a series of muffeled echoing explosions.
The room shakes violently and you fall to the floor just as the lights go out and room is plunged into darkness.
The shaking stops and the room is quiet...the lights flicker on and off.
Pulsing red lights turn on over a door you hadn't noticed before and synthesized voice begins speaking.
