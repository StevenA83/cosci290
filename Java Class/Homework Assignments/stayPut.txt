You are not going out that door into that chaos.
You know the safest thing to do is just sit here and wait to be rescued. 
So that is exactly what you're going to do. 
But as you patiently wait the shaking gets worse. 
The explosion sounds get louder. 
You hear a terrible metal screaching sound as one of the walls of the room bulge. 
It begins to glow orange and radiate intense heat. 
Then suddenly you are pulled violently out of the room. 
The outer wall has collapsed and you've been sucked out of the room. 
You try to scream...but there is no sound in space.
