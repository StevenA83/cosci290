You have left your homeworld to go to Mars, one of the few planets
offering steady employment in this solar system.
You've taken on a job offer from the first, and so far only
corporation on martian soil. Interplanetary Corps has had a monopoly
on martian mineral rights since they were the first to successfully
colonize the iron-rich lands.

Your interplanetary shuttle has just touched down and you make your
way to the reception desk. The person behind the elegant steel desk
greets you.
